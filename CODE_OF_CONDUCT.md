## TMI-LAB Open Source Community Guidelines

At TMI LAB, we recognise and celebrate the creativity and collaboration of open source contributors and the diversity of skills, experiences, cultures, and opinions they bring to the projects and communities they participate in. We value diverse opinions and respectful behaviour.

We are incredibly grateful to the participants in our clinical and pilot studies for their contributions to our research and broader research community.
